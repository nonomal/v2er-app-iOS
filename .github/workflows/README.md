## Required Secrets

To use these workflows, configure the following secrets in your repository:

### For Release Workflow:
- `CERTIFICATES_P12`: Base64 encoded distribution certificate
- `CERTIFICATES_PASSWORD`: Certificate password
- `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD`: Temporary keychain password
- `PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64`: Base64 encoded provisioning profile
- `TEAM_ID`: Apple Developer Team ID
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID`: App Store Connect API key ID
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ISSUER_ID`: API key issuer ID
- `APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY`: API key content

### For Coverage Badge (Optional):
- `GIST_SECRET`: GitHub personal access token with gist scope

## Setup Instructions

1. Generate required certificates and provisioning profiles from Apple Developer portal
2. Encode files to base64:
   ```bash
   base64 -i certificate.p12 -o certificate_base64.txt
   base64 -i profile.mobileprovision -o profile_base64.txt
   ```
3. Add secrets to repository settings
4. Update Xcode version in workflows if needed
5. Customize workflow triggers as needed

## Manual Triggers

Some workflows can be triggered manually from the Actions tab:
- **Release**: Choose release type (major/minor/patch) and TestFlight-only option
- **Dependency Updates**: Manually check for updates

## Maintenance

- Update Xcode version when new versions are released
- Review and update SwiftLint rules as needed
- Adjust test simulator versions for new iOS releases
- Monitor dependency update PRs for breaking changes
